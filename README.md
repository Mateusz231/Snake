# Snake
This was created for an Uni project in Assembly.  
  This is not an typical snake game because you spawn with 10 length.  
  Also eating a star doesn't generate a new one there are already 25 stars to collect.  
  There are 3 types of stars:  
  Red - Removes 200 delay  
  Blue - Removes 400 delay  
  Green - Removes 600 delay  
  All of these remove delay which means snake moves faster.  
  There's a function that every 2 minutes also removes delay.  
  You can use from F1-F8 keys to change snake's color.  
  PRNG is there for generating stars but it's pretty bad implemented.  

  How to run it?
